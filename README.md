# C Assembler Project

This project is a C program that acts as an assembler for a specific architecture. It takes assembly code written for this architecture and translates it into machine code.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/ameermikhail/20465-System-Programming-Laboratory.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
cd 20465-System-Programming-Laboratory
3. **Compile the Program:**
The provided Makefile simplifies the compilation process. Simply run:

4. **Run the Program:**
After compilation, you can run the program by executing the generated executable "./assembler"

5. **Input Assembly Code:**
The program will prompt you to input the assembly code you want to assemble. Enter the code and press Enter.

6. **View Output:**
Once the assembly code is processed, the program will output the corresponding machine code.

7. **Clean Up (Optional):**
If you want to remove the generated object files and executable, you can use "make clean"
